In this incredible bull market virtually every prominent cryptocurrency has experienced impressive gains. 
Unfortunately the market has not responded to this as commissions remains high, until now! We are 
offering rebates on maker prices on our platform for both spot and derivative markets.

##### Makers & Takers

In trading the term maker refers to those participants that place an order at a price that is 
either higher or lower than
the current market price, and so results it the order "making" a market. To further illustrate
take a scenario where someone is willing to sell an asset at $100, if you offer to buy at $90 
you are a maker as no trade is done, if you offer $100 or more you are a taker as you
are "taking" the offer available.

Throughout the trading day you are likely to be both a maker and a taker, this is
not a designated role, it just refers to your participation in the market at any given time.

##### Negative Fees

In contrast to the rest of the market where fees are trending upwards we are offering negative fees 
on both spot and derivatives through rebates for maker orders. The
mechanism is simple, we give you a cut of the commission we take from the takers. With the lowest
taker fees in the industry everyone wins!
