Recently the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry has experienced meteoric growth. However the ballooning transaction fees on the Ethereum network has made the world of DeFi finance a rather expensive undertaking.
Currently Uniswap is incredibly popular among traders due to its permissionless nature, deep liquidity, open 
liquidity provider capabilities, and its range of supported assets - but the fees 
associated with trading on it are the stuff of nightmares.

##### Whales Market

Excessive transaction fees favour those moving large sums as high gas fees have little impact on the overall profit
and loss of the trade. Retail traders with lower volumes are getting hit by the excessive gas prices and are often
bullied out of position by those with larger liquidity reserves.

Though Uniswap has a market rate fee of 0.3% for trades, actually executing a trade can cost north of $100 during peak 
times - when congestion is high and traders need to ensure their orders get through without failing due to 
slippage issues.

As you might imagine, with such high gas fees, it can be very difficult to turn a profit when trading with a low amount, 
since the transaction fees on both sides cut into the profit margin.

##### Front Running

A compounding issue to high fees is the lack of limit order capabilities on decentralized exchanges, 
ultimately you don't really know the price you are going to trade at. Price is determined by volume,
so your trade will either have an inflationary or a deflationary impact on the market price of a 
trading pair. This can be exploited with little effort by taking advantage of the open nature of 
blockchains. 

When you order is placed on a decentralized exchange it remains idle in the processing queue and is 
publicly visible. Trading bots are designed to take advantage of this visibility by placing an additional 
order either before
or directly after your trade, these practices are referred to as [front-running](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontrunning.asp) and 
[tailgating](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tailgating.asp) respectively.

A recent example is that of [Ethermine](https://ethermine.org/), where a combination
of front-running and tailgating resulted in a loss of $250,000 in a single day. 

##### Future

Despite the profit and loss risks associated with decentralized exchanges, they play a very large
part of the cryptoeconomy and offer liquidity to assets that might otherwise struggle to find a marketplace. 
It remains to be seen how the landscape will evolve over time. Will the reduced latencies of Ethereum 2.0
result in an increase in activities such as front-running or impact the high transactions fees?
