In the last year, the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry has experienced what can only be described as meteoric growth. But in recent months, the ballooning transaction fees on the Ethereum network have made the world of DeFi a rather expensive endeavor.

##### Trading Favors Whales

In this bull market, practically every prominent cryptocurrency has demonstrated impressive gains over both short and medium timescales.

However, success in trading has always favored those moving significant sums, and the recent gas fee issues have taken this to a whole other level, by making it extremely difficult for less well-heeled traders to turn a profit on decentralized exchanges.

Right now, Uniswap is incredibly popular among traders due to its permissionless nature, deep liquidity, open liquidity provider capabilities, and massive range of supported assets - but the fees associated with trading on it are simply nightmarish.

##### Uniswap

Though Uniswap has a respectably low 0.3% fee for trades, actually executing a trade can cost north of $100 during peak times — when congestion is high and traders need to ensure their orders get through without failing due to slippage issues.

As you might imagine, with such high gas fees, it can be very difficult to turn a profit when trading with a low amount, since the transaction fees on both sides of the trade (buy then sell) will cut into the profit margin.
